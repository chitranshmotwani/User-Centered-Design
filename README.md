# User-Centered Design

In this repository, you'll find artifacts and documentation showcasing my journey and experience in User-Centered Design. The focus was on utilizing tools like Figma and Balsamiq to create prototypes and conduct evaluations for interface designs.

## Key Highlights

- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Conducted a comprehensive heuristic evaluation on a user interface, identifying design requirements and areas for enhancement.

- **Prototyping with Figma and Balsamiq**: Created interactive prototypes using Figma and Balsamiq, aiming to address identified design requirements and improve user experience.

- **Design Iteration and Evaluation**: Refined initial designs based on feedback and further evaluated the designs to provide detailed recommendations for improvement.

- **Reflective Practice**: Documented and reflected upon the design process, identifying learnings and areas for growth in the realm of user-centered design.

- **User-Centered Design Methodologies**: Gained practical experience in employing user-centered design methodologies, understanding user needs, and effectively utilizing interface evaluation techniques.
